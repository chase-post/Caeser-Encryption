**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
**********************************************************************

None this time, just plenty of debugging.



**********************************************************************
 *  What are the benefits of using functions?                   
**********************************************************************

Functions allow us to write code for a specific process just one time
rather than redundantly repeating ourselves. We can call a function multiple 
times throughout our program to easily reuse a block of code, AND we can modify
the functions inputs easily depending on the context.

**********************************************************************
 *  What are any flaws you can come up with regarding the use of a
 *  Caesar Cipher to store sensitive data?                 
**********************************************************************

Caesar Cipher shifts every data point by the same amount, so if you crack one
letter, you crack every letter. An encryption method that encrypts every letter
by a separate amount would be more difficult to crack.

**********************************************************************
 *  Encrypt the following message with a key value of G, write the 
 *  output below:

 *	unexpected"

**********************************************************************
 *  Crack encrypted_message and output the first line of the 
    decrypted message below

 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
